        <h2 id="intro"> Intro </h2>
        <p> Anyone in my personal life knows that I love skincare! Doing my skincare routine is something that brings me joy and peace. I wanted to take this opportunity to outline my skincare routine and why I use certain products. I'll talk about four different products and one important tip! Keep in mind that just because this routine sort of works for me, it won't necessarily work for you! Each person's skin is different. Please consult a dermatologist for any urgent skincare issues. I'm not an expertâ€“just a boy who likes to have fun! </p>

        <h2 id="cleanser"> Cleanser </h2>
        <img src="imgs/cerave.jpg" class="change-size" alt="cerave green bottle cleanser">
        <div class="column-b"> <p> Everyday, I wash my face with CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser. It's $15 which equates to $1 per ounce. It cleans your face while hydrating it with essential ceramides and hyaluronic acid. Moisturization is key. </p>

        <h2 id="serum"> Serum </h2>
        <img src="imgs/ordinary-hyaluronic-acid.jpg" class="change-size" alt="clear bottle of serum for the face">
        <p> More hydration! Hyaluronic acid helps you maintain the water in your skin cells. The Ordinary Hyaluronic Acid is the cheapest out there on the market and is still really effective.  </p>

        <h2 id="moisturizer"> Moisturizer </h2>
        <img src="imgs/cerave-moisturizer.jpg" class="change-size" alt="cerave moisturizer in blue container">
        <p> CeraVe is truly the most valuable skincare brand. Their moisturizer leaves my skin super buttery smooth! This is best for dry skin as it has a creamy consistency. </p>

        <h2 id="spf"> SPF (Sunscreen) </h2>
        <img src="imgs/beet-spf.jpg" class="change-size" alt="sunscreen in a squeeze bottle">
        <p> SUNSCREEN IS A MUST! If you have only one skincare product, please let it be sunscreen. It will protect your face from harsh UV rays. Use sunscreen even if you're indoors all day and if it's cloudy outside. UV rays are tricky and can still get to you. I like the Krave Beet Shield because it's not greasy and doesn't leave my face chalky. It's kind of expensive, however. I think it's worth it! </p>

        <h2 id="best-tip"> But the best skincare is... </h2>
        <img src="imgs/sleepy-bts.jpg" class="change-size" alt="a boy who is sleeping">
        <p> The most important tip for skincare is sleep. Your body needs to regenerate cells, and resting for 7-8 hours will help retain a youthful glow! </p>
