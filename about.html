        <h2> Christian Paneda </h2>
        <p> I’m Christian Paneda, and I love to be creative. To me, designing is storytelling. It is to turn data into directions–having a deep sense of empathy for a diverse audience of users. I design to explore a curiosity of fostering human connections and innovating immersive experiences. My tenacity comes from my Midwest upbringing. I studied Public Health in undergrad at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. After graduating, I worked for UCLA’s Hub for Health Intervention, Policy & Practice where I led various research projects about leveraging mobile and web-apps to improve health outcomes for minoritized communities by using machine learning, data mining, and creating online social networks. I’m a UX Designer, Web Developer, and graduate student at the University of Michigan School of Information. </p>
